<b>Customer scenario</b></br>
Our security team is asking for help ensuring proper reviews are being done to code being added into our repositories. We have hundreds of repositories in our organization.</br>
- What is the best way we can achieve at scale?</br>
- We are new to some of the out-of-the-box settings and the GitHub API.</br>

Can you please help us create a solution that will accomplish this for our security team?</br>
